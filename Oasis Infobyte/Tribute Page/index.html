            Dhoni made his international debut in December 2004, and he quickly established himself as one of the most talented and successful cricketers of his generation. He is known for his calm demeanor on the field, his exceptional leadership skills, and his outstanding performance as a wicket-keeper and middle-order batsman.

            Dhoni is considered one of the greatest cricket captains in history. He led the Indian team to many memorable victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. He is also the only captain to have won all three major ICC trophies (World Cup, World T20, and Champions Trophy).

He is also a successful businessman and has been associated with several brands as their ambassador.
